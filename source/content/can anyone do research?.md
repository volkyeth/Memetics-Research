yeah, you're literally living in the age with best access to information EVER. go download some textbooks and do your own PhD in the evenings after work. 

there's like a hand full of free LLM models, just ask them what you are curious about and tell them to suggest books and build a syllabus for you. 

 also [arXiv Xplorer](https://arxivxplorer.com/) and [ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/) are two tools that I find very helpful. 

I also use local instances of Deepseek and Llama on [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)  for when I want to ask spicy stuff that I want to keep private. Plus you can edit the model responses and kinda hack around content filters hehe
